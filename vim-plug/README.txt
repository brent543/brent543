This Directory contains the file plugins.vim which tells the plugin manager
which plugins to install. It also contains several directories such as
"vim-fugitive" that contain the source code used by said plugins. For settings
for individual pluggins go to the nvimNightlyConfig/pluginSettings directory
and edit the files for each plugin or create a file for that plugin and source
the file in pluginSettings.vim
